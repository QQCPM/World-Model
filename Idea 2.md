The Computational Power Opportunity

  Your M2 Ultra is a beast - 128GB unified memory means no GPU-CPU transfer bottlenecks. Here's how to think about maximizing it:

  1. Massively Parallel World Simulation

  Instead of collecting data sequentially like the original paper:

  # Original: Single environment, sequential collection
  # Your opportunity: 100+ parallel campus environments

  class MassiveHokieSimulation:
      def __init__(self):
          self.num_parallel_worlds = 128  # One per GB basically
          self.environments = [HokieHallWorld() for _ in range(128)]

      def collect_causal_data(self):
          # Each world explores different causal combinations
          # World 0: Sunny Monday 8am Week 1
          # World 1: Sunny Monday 8am Week 2  
          # World 2: Rainy Monday 8am Week 1
          # etc.

  This gives you exponentially more causal coverage than sequential collection.

  2. The Causal Discovery Engine

  Here's where your hardware becomes critical. Instead of manually specifying causal variables, you could automatically discover them:

  class CausalDiscoverySystem:
      """
      Use your 128GB to maintain massive causal graphs
      - Test every possible causal relationship
      - Learn which variables actually affect navigation
      - Discover emergent patterns (gameday + rain = ???)
      """

      def __init__(self):
          # Maintain causal adjacency matrices for 1000s of variables
          self.potential_causals = {
              'temporal': ['hour', 'day', 'week', 'semester', 'season'],
              'environmental': ['weather', 'temperature', 'visibility'],
              'social': ['event_type', 'crowd_density', 'class_schedule'],
              'infrastructure': ['construction', 'maintenance', 'accessibility']
          }

          # Your RAM can hold massive intervention matrices
          self.intervention_effects = np.zeros((1000, 1000, 32))  # cause x effect x latent_dim

  3. Hierarchical Latent Architecture

  Scale beyond the original's 32D latent:

  class ScalablePerceiver(nn.Module):
      """
      Exploit your RAM for hierarchical representation learning
      """
      def __init__(self):
          # Multi-scale latent hierarchy
          self.global_static = 128    # Campus layout (never changes)
          self.local_static = 256     # Building interiors (rarely change)  
          self.social_dynamic = 512   # Crowd patterns (hourly changes)
          self.micro_dynamic = 256    # Individual pedestrians (second-by-second)

          # Total: 1152D latent (vs original 32D)
          # Your 128GB can easily handle this + gradients

  4. The Really Clever Part: Counterfactual Training

  This is where your causal insight + computational power creates something genuinely new:

  class CounterfactualDreamEngine:
      """
      Train on: "What would happen if this causal variable was different?"
      """

      def forward(self, z_t, action, factual_causals, counterfactual_causals):
          # Standard prediction
          z_next_factual = self.predict(z_t, action, factual_causals)

          # Counterfactual prediction  
          z_next_counter = self.predict(z_t, action, counterfactual_causals)

          # Key insight: Some latents should be invariant to some causals
          # Building locations shouldn't change if weather changes
          # But puddle locations should

          return z_next_factual, z_next_counter

  5. Multi-Agent Emergence

  Your RAM can simulate hundreds of agents simultaneously:

  class EmergentCampusSystem:
      def __init__(self):
          # 500 AI agents, each with their own World Model
          self.agents = [StudentAgent() for _ in range(500)]

          # Watch for emergent behaviors:
          # - Desire paths forming
          # - Crowd bottlenecks  
          # - Social following patterns

      def step(self):
          # Each agent dreams, plans, acts
          # But they're all in the same world
          # Emergence happens naturally

  The Key Insight: Causal Intervention Training

  Here's what makes your approach revolutionary. Traditional World Models learn:
  p(z_t+1 | z_t, action)

  Your version learns:
  p(z_t+1 | z_t, action, do(causal_state))

  The do() operator is Pearl's causal intervention. Your computational power lets you literally test every causal intervention:

  - "What if it's suddenly gameday?"
  - "What if construction blocks this path?"
  - "What if class times shift by 1 hour?"

  - Summer semester (construction everywhere)
  - Gameday conditions (never seen before)
