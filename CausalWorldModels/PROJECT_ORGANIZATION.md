## **FILE ORGANIZATION PRIORITIES**

### ** VALIDATED & STABLE** (Do Not Modify Without Caution):
```python
# These files have validated A+ performance:
causal_architectures/dual_pathway_gru.py # 0.997 score
causal_architectures/causal_mechanisms.py # 0.86 HSIC confidence
causal_envs/temporal_integration.py # 100% temporal tests
training/joint_causal_trainer.py # Integrated pipeline
validation/causal_reasoner_tester.py # Enhanced testing
```

### ** NEEDS ENHANCEMENT** (Active Development Focus):
```python
# These files need targeted improvements:
causal_architectures/structure_learner.py # 0 edges 2-3 edges
causal_architectures/intervention_designer.py # Error handling needed
development/phase2_improvements/ # All new implementations
```

### ** NEW DEVELOPMENT** (Phase 2 Targets):
```python
# Files to be created in Phase 2:
development/phase2_improvements/temporal_chain_reasoner.py
development/phase2_improvements/counterfactual_wrapper.py
development/phase2_improvements/cross_domain_transfer.py
development/phase2_improvements/meta_causal_reasoner.py
```
