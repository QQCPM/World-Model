# CONTINUOUS CAUSAL WORLD MODELS - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## **PARADIGM SHIFT SUMMARY**

**Previous Approach (FAILED)**: Visual World Models with discrete grid navigation
- Used 64x64 RGB images for simple grid traversal problem
- Applied continuous visual learning to discrete graph problem
- Result: 0% success rate due to fundamental algorithm-problem mismatch

**New Approach (SOLUTION)**: Continuous State World Models
- Direct 12D continuous state vectors (no visual compression needed)
- Physics-based continuous control with momentum and collision
- Causal factors integrated into movement dynamics (not visuals)
- Appropriate algorithm for continuous control problem

## **CONTINUOUS ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION**

**Environment Status**: FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- **12D state space**: [agent_pos(2), goal_pos(2), velocity(2), goal_distance(1), causal_encoding(5)]
- **2D continuous control**: velocity commands [-1,1] x [-1,1]
- **Physics simulation**: PyMunk with momentum, friction, collision
- **Causal effects**: Weather reduces movement speed (snow: -33%)
- **Goal reaching**: Confirmed navigation from distance 18.16 5.18

## **REQUIRED SYSTEM UPDATES**

### **IMMEDIATE INCOMPATIBILITIES IDENTIFIED**:

2. **Episode Format**: (100, 64, 64, 3) visual (episode_length, 12) continuous
3. **Model Architecture**: VAE for visual compression Direct state prediction models
4. **Training Pipeline**: Image-based Continuous state sequence modeling
