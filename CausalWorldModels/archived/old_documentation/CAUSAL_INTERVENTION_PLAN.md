# Causal Intervention Testing & Real-World Deployment Plan

## CAUSAL INTERVENTION TESTING FRAMEWORK

### Experiment 1: Weather Intervention Testing
**Objective**: Test if models can handle mid-episode weather changes

**Protocol**:
1. Generate baseline episodes under consistent weather (sunny, rainy, snowy)
2. Create intervention episodes: change weather at timestep T
3. Compare model predictions vs ground truth post-intervention
4. Measure prediction accuracy delta before/after intervention

**Metrics**:
- Intervention Adaptation Rate: How quickly models adjust to new weather
- Counterfactual Accuracy: Prediction accuracy on "what-if" scenarios
- Causal Factor Sensitivity: Quantify impact per weather type

**Expected Results**: GRU Dynamics should show <5% accuracy drop post-intervention

### Experiment 2: Crowd Event Ablation
**Objective**: Test causal factor importance via systematic removal

**Protocol**:
1. Generate episodes with all 5 causal factors active
2. Create ablated versions: remove each factor individually
3. Test model predictions on ablated vs complete episodes
4. Rank causal factors by prediction impact

**Metrics**:
- Factor Importance Score: MSE increase when factor removed
- Causal Graph Recovery: Can we reconstruct factor dependencies?
- Robustness Index: Prediction stability under factor ablation

### Experiment 3: Counterfactual Scenario Generation
**Objective**: Test "what-if" reasoning capabilities

**Protocol**:
1. Take real episodes from test set
2. Generate counterfactual versions: different weather/events
3. Run both real and counterfactual through models
4. Compare prediction differences vs physics simulation differences

**Metrics**:
- Counterfactual Coherence: Do model predictions match physics changes?
- Causal Effect Magnitude: Quantify predicted vs actual effect sizes
- Temporal Persistence: How long do intervention effects last?

### Experiment 4: Novel Causal Combination Testing
**Objective**: Test generalization to unseen causal factor combinations

**Protocol**:
1. Identify causal combinations not in training data
2. Generate test episodes with these novel combinations
3. Compare model performance on novel vs seen combinations
4. Measure generalization capability

**Metrics**:
- Generalization Gap: Performance difference on novel vs seen combinations
- Causal Compositionality: Can models combine known effects correctly?
- Out-of-Distribution Robustness: Prediction quality on edge cases
