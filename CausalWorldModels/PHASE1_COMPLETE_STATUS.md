## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS PLAN - PHASE 1B & PHASE 2A**

### **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (This Week)**
1. **📈 Generate Training Visualizations**
   - Plot all 8 training curves from log files
   - Create comparative loss charts
   - Document convergence patterns

2. **🔬 Deep Model Analysis**
   - Run causal intervention tests on all models
   - Test reconstruction quality across causal conditions
   - Measure latent space utilization

3. **🎯 Architecture Selection**
