# QUICK START GUIDE - PHASE 2 DEVELOPMENT

## **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

**Current Status**: Phase 1 Complete | Phase 2 Ready
**Priority**: Fix critical failures first, then enhance advanced capabilities
**Timeline**: 12 weeks to expert-level causal reasoning

---

## **WEEK 1 - CRITICAL FIXES START HERE**

### ** TOP PRIORITY: Counterfactual Architecture Fix**

**Problem**: Complete failure (0.000 score) due to input dimension mismatches
**Target**: 0.000 0.4+ (basic functionality)

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Create the counterfactual wrapper
cd development/phase2_improvements/
touch counterfactual_wrapper.py
```

**Required Fix**:
```python
# Input dimension adapter needed:
# Expected 19, got 12 - fix the input size mismatch
# Architecture needs to handle factual vs counterfactual trajectories
```

### ** SECONDARY: Temporal Chain Enhancement**

**Problem**: Limited multi-step reasoning (0.382 score)
**Target**: 0.382 0.5+ (improved temporal understanding)

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Create temporal chain reasoner
cd development/phase2_improvements/
touch temporal_chain_reasoner.py
```

---

## **QUICK VALIDATION CYCLE**

### **Daily Testing**:
```bash
# Run subset of extreme challenges
cd tests/
python -c "
from extreme_causal_challenge import ExtremeCausalChallenger
challenger = ExtremeCausalChallenger()
# Test specific challenges you're working on
"
```

### **Weekly Full Validation**:
```bash
# Full extreme challenge suite
cd tests/
python extreme_causal_challenge.py
```

## **KEY FILES TO WORK WITH**

### ** VALIDATED (Do Not Break)**:
```python
core/causal_architectures/dual_pathway_gru.py # A+ (0.997)
core/causal_architectures/causal_mechanisms.py # A+ (0.86)
core/causal_envs/temporal_integration.py # A+ (100%)
training/joint_causal_trainer.py # Integrated pipeline
```

### ** DEVELOPMENT TARGETS**:
```python
development/phase2_improvements/counterfactual_wrapper.py # Week 1
development/phase2_improvements/temporal_chain_reasoner.py # Week 2
development/phase2_improvements/cross_domain_transfer.py # Week 5-6
development/phase2_improvements/meta_causal_reasoner.py # Week 7-8
```

### ** TESTING FRAMEWORK**:
```python
tests/extreme_causal_challenge.py # Ultimate validation
tests/test_phase_1_improvements.py # Enhancement testing
validation/causal_reasoner_tester.py # Core validation
```

---

## **ARCHITECTURAL UNDERSTANDING**

### **System Core**:
```python
# The heart of validated causal reasoning:
DualPathwayCausalGRU(
observational_pathway, # Correlation learning
interventional_pathway, # Causal learning
mmd_specialization, # Enhanced in Phase 1
pathway_balance # A+ performance
)

CausalMechanismModules(
hsic_independence, # Enhanced in Phase 1
mechanism_isolation, # 0.86 confidence
stress_resistance # A grade performance
)
```

### **Integration Points**:
```python
# Where Phase 2 improvements integrate:
joint_causal_trainer.py # Training pipeline integration
causal_reasoner_tester.py # Validation integration
extreme_causal_challenge.py # Ultimate testing
```

---

## **EMERGENCY FIXES (If Needed)**

### **If System Breaks**:
```bash
# Restore to Phase 1 validated state
git checkout main
# Or restore from validated backup
```

### **If Tests Fail**:
```bash
# Check core validations still pass
cd tests/
python test_phase_1_improvements.py
# Should show: Target achieved: True
```

### **If Integration Issues**:
```bash
# Test individual components
cd core/causal_architectures/
python causal_mechanisms.py # Should show HSIC working
python dual_pathway_gru.py # Should show specialization
```

## **SUCCESS METRICS TRACKING**

### **Track These Numbers**:
```python
# Current baseline (Phase 1 complete):
CHALLENGE_SCORES = {
'compositional_causality': 0.978, # KEEP EXCELLENT
